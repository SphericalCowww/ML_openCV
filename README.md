# Projects using OpenCV
Since these are projects using OpenCV:

    pip3 install opencv-python
There are many resources online and so the particular references used are not listed.

## Car Plate Recognition
The following codes takes in an image that has car plates (PATH to change directly in the code), uses the OpenCV edge finder to capture rectangular structures in the image that resembles a car plate, and uses `pytesseract` to read out the plate numbers (note that `pytesseract` has its own installation procedure). The code runs on python3:

    python3 carPlateRecog_OpenCV.py
